Graph is collection of nodes and connections between these nodes

Uses:

1. Social Networking
2. Location /
3. Routing Algorithms
4. Visual Heirarchy
5. File Systems optimizations

Essesntial Graph Terms:

1. Vertex: a node
2. edge: connections between the nodes

Types of Graph:

1. Unweighted Undirected Graph:
   Where connections have no directions / no polarity represented using line.
2. Unweighted directed Graph
   Where connections have directions / polarity represented using arrow
3. Weighted Undirected Graph:
   Where connections have no directions / no polarity represented using line. Weight is assigned to edges
4. Weighted directed Graph:
   Where connections have directions / polarity represented using arrow.Weight is assigned to edges

Representing Graph:

1. Adjacency Matrix:
   Takes more space
   slower to iterate over all edges
   Faster to look up at particular / specific edge
2. Adjacency List
   Can take a less space
   Faster to iterate all over the edges
   can be slower to lookup specific edge
